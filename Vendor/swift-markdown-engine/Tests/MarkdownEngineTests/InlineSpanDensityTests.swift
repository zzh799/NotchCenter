//
//  Inline parse cost against span density within one region (#109).
//
//  Two halves, and the first is the one that matters: the containment rewrite
//  has to be a pure performance change. `corpusFingerprint` folds the parsed
//  tree of 4000 pseudo-random inputs into one value, recorded on the PRE-rewrite
//  parser at the merge base (1a2bd74, i.e. with #118) — in the spirit of
//  `GoldenCorpusTests`, except the baseline covers shapes nobody would think to
//  write by hand.
//
//  Re-record it ONLY on a parser that predates the rewrite, otherwise it just
//  ratifies whatever the rewrite does. It is also a bare hash: when it fails,
//  diff `String(describing:)` per input against the old parser to see what moved.
//
//  The second half asserts the cost curve is linear in spans rather than
//  quadratic, so the scans can't quietly come back. It is OPT-IN via
//  `MDE_PERF=1 swift test` — see `perfGateEnabled`.

/// suites competing for cores throughout the measurement window. Gating CI on
/// that number buys flakiness, not safety — and no bound fixes it, since the
